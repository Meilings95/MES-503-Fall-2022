### Housekeeping

**This assignment is due via email to sonora.meiling@uvi.edu by Tuesday 10/25 at 10am. Late assignments will be deducted points. Please send as a word document with the file name YOURLASTNAME_TakeHomeAssignment4.docx (e.g. Meiling_TakeHomeAssignment4a.docx)**

### Urchins two-way ANOVA
#### Q1: Variables (0.5 pt)
Identify the independent predictor variable(s) (X) and the dependent response variable (Y). Make sure to specify if dependent predictor variables are fixed or random

     - Independent predictor variable:
     
     - Dependent predictor variable:


#### Q2: Hypotheses (0.5 pt)

      What are the RESEARCH null and alternative hypotheses?
        - Null:
        - Alternative:
      What are the STATISTICAL null and alternative hypotheses?
        - Null:
        - Alternative:
        
#### Q3: Results (4 pts)

*In 2-4 sentences explain the results of your analyses as if you were writting a scientific manuscript for peer review (2 pts). Make sure to show your work (1) and include a figure with proper labels and a figure caption (1 pt).*

View(urchins)

urchins$Sample <- NULL

urchin_groups <- split(urchins$growth,list(urchins$predators, urchins$source))
bartlett.test(urchin_groups) #not significant, equal variance, don't need to transform

urchin_ANOVA <- aov(growth ~ predators*source, urchins)
urchin_residuals <- residuals(urchin_ANOVA)
shapiro.test(urchin_residuals) #not significant, normal distribution, don't need to transform

#highest growth rates when most predators are present (3), lowest with absence of predators. Growth rates are significantly higher the more predators are present.
